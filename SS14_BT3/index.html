We keep this love in a photograph. We made these memories for ourselves. Where our eyes are never closing. Hearts are never broken. And time's forever frozen, still. So you can keep me. Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans. Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet. You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home. Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul. And it's the only thing that I know, know. I swear it will get easier. Remember that with every piece of ya. Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die";
